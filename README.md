# Passion.

---------------------------------

### Special interest: Nintendo, specifically the older consoles and games and DC comics, movies, literally live laugh love.

Hello! I'm MarineGuy. I am a big debater, and I love education. Currently, I am mentally unwell, so I might not be talking a lot or making friends. I am trying to focus more on my health rather than interactions with others. 

Yes, I do debate with people. I find it interesting how other people view things, and it also educates me a bit. If you do want to debate with me, I am fine with it, but if it's something I'm not well educated in, then I won't debate, but I'd love to hear about it. I enjoy learning new things. I used to be into marine biology, so I am educated in that topic. I love sucking in all the knowledge possible. There are so many interesting things to learn, so please don't be afraid to chat about anything you'd like

Note: I have been followed for quite a while, I am not speaking digitally, but in real life. It could just be coincidences mixed with my deluded ideations that someone is watching me. But I have physically seen people in the flesh following me. I am extremely paranoid about this. I am making notes about what these people look like, so if I see them again following me, I can report them to the police.
