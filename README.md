-I said, "Are you real?" He said, "I'm as real as you make me".-


Hello I'm Winston, I am a big talker and love to spread knowledge to others. I am planning on making a folder of all my research and publicly linking it here! I am a guy that just sucks in all the knowledge I find possible. I'd love to hear facts from any players but they have to be logical facts and not just I heard this but I don't know if it's true. I tend to make sure my knowledge I gain is from trusted sources like articles, books, and google scholar. I do not like google & the wikipedia as most of the stuff on there isn't reliable and anybody can change wikipedias stuff. 

Currently I'm not in the best state of mind, I have became delusional, extremely paranoid, and I have been isolating myself. I am sorry if I do not respond to you with the upmost respect but at the moment I can not promise that I will be kind when it comes to talking. 




Things I will mention because it effects how I socialize and it will be better if you know before interacting with me:

I have autism, intermittent explosive disorder, ptsd, adhd, and yes I'm getting help but I'm in psychosis.
