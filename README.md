# "Born to dilly dally, forced to lock in."

---------------------------------

### Special interest: Nintendo, specifically the older consoles and games.

This is in the process of making so please be patient.


I am a troubled person, which I'm aware of, that's why I will say this once. Please do not friend me if you can't handle someone who is mentally ill. I have extreme paranoia, and it has caused distrust with many people. I am extremely open about these things, though, because I was never taught that it is wrong to be open. I don't know why I'm paranoid; my counselor thinks it's because of something in the past, but honestly, who knows? I believed I'm being watched, I have been followed before, I have had experiences I can not explain properly, a lot has happened that made me believe certain things most would think is out of touch with reality. Don't worry, I am in a 4c school-based program that is supposed to help me. I can not promise I will get better, so please don't try to be my friend if you can't deal with me.

Anyways, let's change the subject. I am a big fan of DC comics, movies, games, and TV shows. I love the DC universe. I am currently watching the TV show Gotham and watching a gameplay of Batman: Arkham night! I am also a big fan of Nintendo games like tomodatchi life, miitopia, animal crossing new leaf, luigi's mansion, and much more!
