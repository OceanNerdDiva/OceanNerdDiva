-I said, "Are you real?" He said, "I'm as real as you make me".-

HEY! BIG NERD AND RESEARCHER! I made a poem that I'd like to share with the world.
--------
An Endless spiral.

By: Winston
 
I do believe in soulmates, not in the way most would think.
No roses, no hand to hold, but instead someone who sees the rot beneath a blooming flower.

I believe someone out there will save me. Save me from the mental loop I cannot break. A spiral that doesn’t go downward but inward, curling tighter each day. Until the walls start to speak,

Each morning arrives colorless, hollow, and familiar. The mirror says nothing new. I walk through the world on autoplay. Smiling like a puppet with glass for skin. 

I wonder if time is mocking me. Each hour drips like a leaking faucet, not loud but rhythmic. Each night caves into itself, digging my grave. 

Madness doesn’t scream, it whispers. Lingers in the cracks of silent moments, until I break and the glass drives deep where the ache already lived.

And yet I still believe that someone out there will touch the loop and melt it. Who will put a hand on my shoulder and look at me, will say, “I see it too.”

----------------
This poem is about my experience with a mental loop, everything is the same, which makes me break down into insanity. I am not that poetic, but I like to express myself the best I can, hope you like it! ^_^ Anyways, let's get to know me!

Hello, I'm Winston. I am a big talker and love to spread knowledge to others. I am planning on making a folder of all my research and publicly linking it here! I am a guy that sucks in all the knowledge I find possible. I'd love to hear facts from any players, but they have to be logical facts and not just I heard this, but I don't know if it's true. I tend to make sure my knowledge I gain is from trusted sources like articles, books, and Google Scholar. I do not like Google & Wikipedia as most of the stuff on there isn't reliable, and anybody can change Wikipedia's stuff. 

Currently, I'm not in the best state of mind. I have become delusional, extremely paranoid, and I have been isolating myself. I am sorry if I do not respond to you with the utmost respect, but at the moment, I can not promise that I will be kind when it comes to talking. 

Things I will mention because they affect how I socialize, and it will be better if you know before interacting with me:

I have autism, intermittent explosive disorder, ptsd, adhd, and yes I'm getting help but I'm in psychosis.


These aren't fandoms I'm in, It's my interests : Daniel Tiger, Sesame Street (specifically the vintage episodes), chemistry, Dc comics, zoology, marine biology, SpongeBob, psychology, Danny Phantom, I have lots of interests, so I can't really name them all.

GUYS I REALIZED WHY I AM SO INTO MARINE BIOLOGY i learned that I just like all kind of fields in science and biology, Marine biology was the first thing I learned and I stuck with it for so long. Now I'm into chemistry but still learning marine biology. I don't think marine biology will ever die out for me.

My special interest is: Nintendo, mostly the 3ds games like tomodatchi, miitopia, animal crossing new leaf, happy home designer, fantasy life, yeah I could go on.
