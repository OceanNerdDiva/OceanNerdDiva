Yes I have mental health issues, no I'm not going to share it all with you just because you feel bad.

Things I will mention because it effects how I socialize and it will be better if you know before interacting.

I have autism, intermittent explosive disorder, ptsd, adhd, and yes I'm getting help but I'm in psychosis.
