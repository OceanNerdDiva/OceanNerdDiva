-I said, "Are you real?" He said, "I'm as real as you make me".-

HEY! BIG NERD AND RESEARCH HERE! I MAKE DOCUMENTS ON THINGS I WANT TO LEARN ABOUT! HERE IS MY CURRENT ONE THAT IS A WORK IN PROGRESS! --> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sNU7Dz3kFFK_jPBcMbVO89cTeD72AHhENevPjCQkprE/edit?usp=sharing

Hello, I'm Winston. I am a big talker and love to spread knowledge to others. I am planning on making a folder of all my research and publicly linking it here! I am a guy that sucks in all the knowledge I find possible. I'd love to hear facts from any players, but they have to be logical facts and not just I heard this, but I don't know if it's true. I tend to make sure my knowledge I gain is from trusted sources like articles, books, and Google Scholar. I do not like Google & Wikipedia as most of the stuff on there isn't reliable, and anybody can change Wikipedia's stuff. 

Currently, I'm not in the best state of mind. I have become delusional, extremely paranoid, and I have been isolating myself. I am sorry if I do not respond to you with the utmost respect, but at the moment, I can not promise that I will be kind when it comes to talking. 

Things I will mention because they affect how I socialize, and it will be better if you know before interacting with me:

I have autism, intermittent explosive disorder, ptsd, adhd, and yes I'm getting help but I'm in psychosis.


These aren't fandoms I'm in, It's my interests : Daniel Tiger, Sesame Street (specifically the vintage episodes), chemistry, zoology, SpongeBob, danny phantom, I have lots of interests so I can't really name them all.
