-I said, "Are you real?" He said, "I'm as real as you make me".-

HEY! BIG NERD AND RESEARCHER! Below me is a note for certain players on Ponytown.
--------
I'm fed up with people online, especially on Pony Town, who go around faking disabilities and neurological disorders. You're not autistic just because you're childish. You don't have adhd just because you are hyper. You don't have DID just because you roleplay with yourself and make characters in your head. You aren't schizophrenic just because you saw one shadow in the dark. Stop faking! It's not quirky, cute, or silly. It's disappointing and offensive. If you are concerned, you might have a disability, please talk with your parents or the school counselor. When I was little, I researched autism for 3 years, I talked to my school counselor about it, and he called my parents to get permission for me to take special education testing. Soon enough, I got an IEP. The process wasn't easy. If you know your parents won't take into consideration that you're struggling, then write everything in a document, keep writing, and once you're 18, you don't have to have your parents' permission for anything. There are real paths to support, but faking isn't one of them.

Mental illness isn’t cute. Neurodivergence isn’t a roleplay. It’s our reality. Please respect that for God's sake.

Hello, I'm Winston. I am a big talker and love to spread knowledge to others. I am planning on making a folder of all my research and publicly linking it here! I am a guy that sucks in all the knowledge I find possible. I'd love to hear facts from any players, but they have to be logical facts and not just I heard this, but I don't know if it's true. I tend to make sure my knowledge I gain is from trusted sources like articles, books, and Google Scholar. I do not like Google & Wikipedia as most of the stuff on there isn't reliable, and anybody can change Wikipedia's stuff. 

Currently, I'm not in the best state of mind. I have become delusional, extremely paranoid, and I have been isolating myself. I am sorry if I do not respond to you with the utmost respect, but at the moment, I can not promise that I will be kind when it comes to talking. 

Things I will mention because they affect how I socialize, and it will be better if you know before interacting with me:

I have autism, intermittent explosive disorder, ptsd, and adhd

These aren't fandoms I'm in, It's my interests : Daniel Tiger, Sesame Street (specifically the vintage episodes), chemistry, Dc comics, zoology, marine biology, SpongeBob, psychology, Danny Phantom, I have lots of interests, so I can't really name them all.

GUYS I REALIZED WHY I AM SO INTO MARINE BIOLOGY i learned that I just like all kind of fields in science and biology, Marine biology was the first thing I learned and I stuck with it for so long. Now I'm into chemistry but still learning marine biology. I don't think marine biology will ever die out for me.

My special interest is: Nintendo, mostly the 3ds games like tomodatchi, miitopia, animal crossing new leaf, happy home designer, fantasy life, yeah I could go on. I also like science but it dies after a while. I liked nintendo ever since I was introduced to my moms 3ds when I was 5.
