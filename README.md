Status : Pissed. My reason of being pissed is basically someone said this ""age players dni" yet you act like a toddler.. hmmm!!" they said that because I have age play in my DNI list. So let's explain why what they said is wrong. First off, age play does not mean mainly acting like a toddler. Age play is a roleplay between adults, like relationships, mostly sexual. It's hard to explain properly, but it's a really bad thing. They mention how I act like a toddler, but funny thing is, I NEVER TALK IN PONYTOWN. I sit in Ponytown mainly with my friends in Party chat but not publicly. If it's because I like childish things and you get so pressed about my own interests and personality, then just don't interact? This comment made me angry, but I understand why they would be confused, yet you shouldn't act all smart without thinking about whether what you're saying is okay.
